## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  Trying to make my projects run without 47 error messages.

* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  React JS, one bug at a time.

* ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
  Anything fun, creative, and slightly chaotic.

* ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:
  Remembering semicolons.

* ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
  Random tech stuff, memes, or how to accidentally overcomplicate simple problems.

* ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  Drop me a message here on GitHub.

* ðŸ˜„ Pronouns:
  He/Him

* âš¡ Fun fact:
  I enjoy turning chaotic ideas into working codeâ€”sometimes on purpose, sometimes by accident.
